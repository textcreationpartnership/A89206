            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Sacred Discipline of the Church described in the Word of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the judgement of the godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Presbyterian party, which lived in the daies of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed MEMORIE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Discipline of Christs Church, that is necessary for all times, is delivered by Christ, and set down in the holy Scriptures. Therefore the true and lawfull Discipline is to bee fetched from them, and from thence alone, and that which resteth upon any other foundation, ought to bee esteemed unlawfull and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</p>
            <p>Of all particular Churches, there is one and the same right order and form. Therefore also no one may challenge to it self any power over others, nor any right which doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like agree to others.</p>
            <p>The Ministers of publique charges in every particular Church ought to bee called and appointed to their charges by a lawfull Ecclesiasticall calling, such as hereafter is set down. All these for the divers regard of their severall kinds are of equall power amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>No man can bee lawfully called to publique charge in any
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:159788:3"/>Church, but hee that is fit to discharge the same. And none is to bee accounted fit but hee that is endued with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of all the godly, that is, with Faith and a blamelesse life. And further also with those that are proper to that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery wherein hee is to bee used, and necessary for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the same; Whereupon for triall of those gifts some convenient way and examination is to bee used.</p>
            <p>The party to bee called must first bee elected, then hee is to bee ordained to that charge whereunto hee is chosen by the Prayers of that Church, whereunto hee is to bee admitted, the mutuall duties of him and of the Church, being before laid open.</p>
            <p>The Ministers of the Church are: first, they that are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Word. In their examination it is specially to bee taken heed unto that they bee apt to teach, and tryed men, not newly planted and converted to the Faith.</p>
            <p>Now these Ministers of the Word, are first Pastours, which doe administer the Word and Sacraments. Then Teachers which are occupied in wholsome Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Besides these, there are also Elders, which watch over the life and behaviour of every man; and Deacons which have care over the poore.</p>
            <p>Further, in every particular Church there ought to bee a Presbytery, which is a Consistory, and as it were a Senate of Elders. Under the name of Elders here are contained they who in the Churches minister doctrine, and they who are properly called Elders.</p>
            <p>By the common councell of the Eldership all things are directed that belong to the state of their Church. First, such as belong to the guidance of the whole body of it, in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and common assembly, gathered together in the name of the Lord. That all things may bee done in them duly, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to edification.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:159788:3"/>
            <p>Secondly, Then also such as pertain to particular persons. First, to all the members of that Church, that the good may enjoy all the priviledges that belong unto them; that the wicked may bee corrected with Ecclesiasticall censures accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quality of the fault private and publique, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing and by removing either from the Lords Supper, by suspention (as it is commonly called) or out of the Church by excommunication. Then which belong specially to the Ministers of publique charge in the Church, to their calling, either to bee begun or ended, and ended either by relieving or punishing them, and that for a time by suspention, or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by deposition.</p>
            <p>For directing of the Eldership, let the Pastour bee set over it, or if there bee moe Pastours then one in the same Church, Let the Pastours doe it in their turnes.</p>
            <p>But yet in all the greater affaires of the Church, as in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating of any, and in choosing or deposing of Church Ministers, nothing may bee concluded without the knowledge and consent of the Church.</p>
            <p>Particular Churches ought to yeeld mutuall help one to another, for which cause they are to communicate amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>The end of this communicating together, is, that all things in them may bee so directed both in regard of Doctrine, and also of Discipline, as by the Word of God they ought to be.</p>
            <p>Therefore the things that belong hereunto are determined by the common opinion of those who meet so to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate together, and whatsoever is to bee amended, furthered, or procured in any of these several Churches, or in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that belong to that Assembly. Wherein albeit no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church hath power over another, yet every particular Church of the same resort, meeting, and counsell ought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the opinion of more Churches with whom they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:159788:4"/>
            <p>For holding of those meetings and Assemblies there are to be chosen by every Church belonging to that Assembly, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall men from among the Elders, who are to have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions from them, and so to be sent to the Assembly. There must be also a care had, that the things they shall returne to have been godly agreed on by the meetings, be diligently observed by the Churches.</p>
            <p>Further, in such Assemblies there is also to be chosen one that may be set over the Assemblies who may moderate and direct them. His duty is to see that the Assembly bee held godly, quietly, and comely. Therefore it belongeth unto him to begin and end the Conference with Prayer; to know every mans instructions; to propound in order the things that are to be handled; to gather their Opinions, and to propound what is the opinion of the greater part. It is also the part of the rest of the Assembly to speak their opinions of the things propounded, godly and quietly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Synodicall Discipline gathered out of the Synods and use of the Churches which have restored it according to the Word of God, and out of sundry Bookes that are written of the same, and referred unto certain Heads:</hi>

               <head>Of the necessity of a Calling.</head>
               <p>Let no man thrust himself into the executing of any part of Publique charge in the administration of the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Discipline, or care over the Poore. Neither let any such sue of seek for any Publique charge of the Church, but let every one tarry untill he be lawfully called.</p>

               <p>Let none be called but unto some certain Charge ordained of God, and to the exercising of the same in some particular Congregation; and he that is so called, let him be so bound to that Church, that he may not after be of any other, or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159788:4"/>depart from it without just and necessary cause, which is to be judged of by those that have lawfull authority so to do.</p>
               <p>Let none be called, but they that have first subscribed the confession of Doctrine and Discipline, whereof let them be admonished to have Copies with themselves.</p>

               <head>Of the examination of Ministers.</head>
               <p>In the examination of Ministers, the testimony of the place from whence they come is to be demanded, whereby it may be understood what life and conversation hee hath been of, and whether he hath been addicted to any Heresie, or to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and strange questions, and idle speculations; or rather, whether he be accompted sound, and consenting in all things to the Doctrine received in the Church. Whereunto if hee agree, he is also to expound some part of the holy Scriptures twice or oftner, as it shall seem meet to the Examiners, and that before the Conference, and that Church which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed. Let him also be demanded of the principall Heads of Divinity, and whether he will diligently execute and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Ministery; and in the execution thereof propound unto himself, not his own desires and commodities, but the glory of God, and edification of the Church. Lastly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will be studious and carefull to maintaine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve wholsome Doctrine, and Ecclesiasticall Discipline. Thus let the Minister be examined not onely by one El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership, but also by some greater meeting and Assembly.</p>

               <p>Let the Minister that is to Preach, name a Psalme, or a part of a Psalme (beginning with the first, and so proceeding) that may be sung by the Church, noting to them the end of their singing, to wit, the glory of God, and their own edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. After the Psalme let a short admonition to the people, follow of preparing themselves to pray duely unto God.</p>
               <p>Then let there be made a Prayer containing a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession first of the guilt of sinne both originall and actuall and of the punishment which is due by the Law for them both.

Last of all, let the Congregation be dismissed with some convenient form of blessing taken out of the Scriptures, such as is <hi>Num.</hi> 6.24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13.</p>

               <p>Let him that shall Preach, choose some part of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scriptures to expound, and not of the Apocrypha.</p>
               <p>Further in his ordinary Ministery, let him not take Postills, (as they are called) but some whole book of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:159788:5"/>especially of the New Testament to expound in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In choise whereof, regard is to bee had both of the Ministers ability, and of the edification of the Church.</p>
               <p>Hee that preacheth must performe two things; the first that his speech bee uncorrupt; which is to be considered both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the doctrine, that it bee holy, sound, wholesome, and profitable to edification, not devilish, hereticall, leavened, corrupt, fabulous, curious, or contentious. And also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the manner of it, that it bee proper to the place which is handled, that is, which either is contained plainly in the very words, or if it bee gathered by consequent that the same bee fit and cleare, and such as may rise upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the words, grace of speech, and suit of the matter, and not bee allegoricall, strong wrested, and farre fetched. Now let that which is such and cheifly which is fittest for the times and occasions of the Church bee delivered. Further let the explication, confirmation, inlargement, and application, and the whole treatise and handling of it bee in the vulgar tongue, and let the whole confirmation, and proof be made by arguments, testimonies, and examples taken one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the holy Scriptures, applyed fitly and according to the naturall meaning of the places that are alledged.</p>
               <p>The second thing to bee performed by him that preacheth is reverend gravity. This is considered first in the stile or phrase and manner of speech that it bee spirituall, pure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, simple, and applyed to the capacity of the people, not such as humane wisedome teacheth, nor savoring of new fanglednesse, nor either so affectate as it may serve for pomp and austentaion; or so carelesse and base as become<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A fit way to call a Provinciall Councell may be this; the care thereof (except themselves will determine of it) may be committed to the particular Eldership of some Conference within the Province, which by advise of the same Conference
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:159788:11"/>may appoint the place and time for the meeting of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Synod.</p>
               <p>To that Church or Eldership are to bee sent, the matters that seemed to the particular Conferences more difficult for them to take order in, and such as belong to the Churches of the whole Province, which is to bee done diligently, and in good time, that the same may in due season give notice of the place, and time of the Synod, and of the matters to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated therein, that they which shall bee sent, may come the better prepared, and judge of them according to the advise of the conferences.</p>
               <p>Two Ministers, and as many Elders are to bee sent from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Conference unto the Provinciall Synod. The same is to bee held every half yeare or oftner, till the Discipline bee setled. It is to bee held three moneths before every Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Synod, that they may prepare and make ready those things that pertaine to the Nationall. The Acts of the Provinciall Synod are to bee sent unto the Nationall by the Eldership of that Church in which it was holden, and every Minister is to bee furnished with a Copie of them, and with the reasons of the same.</p>
               <p>A Nationall Synod or Convocation, is a meeting of the chosen men of every Province, within the Dominion of the same Nation, and Civill Government.</p>
               <p>The way to call it, (unlesse it shall determine otherwise) may bee the same with the Provinciall, that is, by the Eldership of some particular Church, which shall appoint the time and place of the next Nationall Convocation, but not otherwise then by the advice of their Provinciall Synod.</p>
               <p>Out of every Provinciall Synod there are to bee chosen three Ministers, and as many Elders to bee sent to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall. They are to handle the things pertaining to the

               <p>This Discipline, intituled the Discipline of the Church described in the Word of God as farre as we can judge, is taken and drawn from the most pure fountaines of the Word of God; and containeth in it the Discipline of the Church that is necessary, essentiall, and common to all ages of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Synodicall also adjoyned, as it resteth upon the same foundations is likewise necessary and perpetuall. But as far as it is not expresly confirmed by authority of the holy Scripture, but is applyed to the use and times of the Church as their divers state may require according to the Analogie and generall rules of the same Scripture is to be judged pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the Churches that receive it. But may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in such things as belong not to the essence of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline upon a like godly reason, as the divers estate of the Churches may require.</p>
